# Walrus Starter Kit Branding & Logo

## 1. Brand Positioning

The Walrus Starter Kit positions itself as the **"Arctic Shipyard"**—the solid, reliable scaffolding for building on the Walrus Protocol.

- **Relationship:** Complies with Sui's "water/fluid" identity (Sui = Water) but adopts the "solid/ice" state of the Walrus storage layer.
- **Archetype:** The "Efficient Builder." Where Walrus is the raw storage (the ocean), the Starter Kit is the vessel (the boat/structure) that makes it usable.
- **Vibe:** Rugged but modern. Less "corporate SaaS," more "indie hacker tool."

## 2. Logo Concepts

### Concept A: The "Pixel-Crate" (Primary Recommendation)

- **Visual:** A 3D isometric shipping crate (symbolizing storage/packages) drawn in the official Walrus **pixel-art style**. The front face of the crate features a simplified pixelated Walrus tusk or face.
- **Meaning:** Combines "Walrus" (mascot) + "Starter Kit" (shipping container/package) + "Blobs" (storage units).
- **Versatility:** Works perfectly as a favicon (16x16 pixels) and CLI ascii art.

### Concept B: The "Terminal Tusk"

- **Visual:** A minimalist, vector-based design where two curved Walrus tusks form the shape of a command line prompt (`>_`) or the roof of a house (scaffolding).
- **Meaning:** Direct literal connection between the animal and the developer environment (CLI).
- **Style:** Clean lines, similar to Vercel/Next.js geometry.

### Concept C: The "Iceberg Stack"

- **Visual:** Three horizontal layers (tech stack) floating like an iceberg. The top layer is the "tip" (visible UI), bottom layers are "deep storage" (Walrus).
- **Meaning:** Deep storage capabilities with a visible, accessible surface (the starter kit).

## 3. Color Palette

**Primary (Sui Ecosystem Integration)**

- `#4DA2FF` **Sui Ocean** (Official Sui Brand Color - use for primary actions)
- `#111827` **Deep Trench** (Backgrounds/Terminal Black)

**Secondary (Walrus Specific)**

- `#9CA3AF` **Walrus Grey** (Neutral UI elements, "Tusk" color)
- `#06B6D4` **Arctic Cyan** (Accents, highlights, "Fresh" feeling)

**Terminal Safe Colors**

- Success: `#10B981` (Emerald)
- Warning: `#F59E0B` (Amber)
- Error: `#EF4444` (Red)

## 4. AI Logo Generation Prompt

**Prompt for Midjourney/DALL-E:**

> A minimalist logo symbol for a developer tool called "Walrus Starter Kit". The design should feature a stylized shipping crate or box that subtly resembles a walrus face or tusks. Use a pixel-art or 8-bit aesthetic to match the "Walrus Protocol" crypto brand. Colors: Electric Blue (#4DA2FF), Deep Grey, and White. Background: Solid white. Style: Flat vector, geometric, tech-focused, similar to Vercel or Docker logos. No text.

## 5. Typography & Voice

- **Font:** _Inter_ or _JetBrains Mono_ (for code/CLI).
- **Voice:** "Ship faster than the ice melts."
- **Tagline Options:**
  - _The solid ground for decentralized storage._
  - _Scaffold. Store. Ship._
  - _Walrus made simple._

## 6. Key Insights

1.  **Embrace Pixels:** Walrus Protocol's marketing uses pixel art. The Starter Kit should adopt this to feel "native" rather than "corporate."
2.  **Blue & Grey:** Stick to the Sui Blue anchor, but use cool greys/cyans to evoke the "Arctic/Storage" theme without clashing.
3.  **Simplicity:** The logo must be legible at 32x32px (favicon) and convertible to ASCII art for the CLI welcome screen.
